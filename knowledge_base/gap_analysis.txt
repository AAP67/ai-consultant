FRAMEWORK NAME: Gap Analysis

WHAT IT IS:
A structured method to identify the difference between where an organization 
is today (Current State) and where it wants to be (Future State), then create 
an actionable plan to close that gap.

WHEN TO USE IT:
- Process improvement projects
- Performance issues or shortfalls
- Strategic planning initiatives
- Post-merger integration
- Digital transformation
- Operational inefficiencies

HOW TO APPLY IT:

Step 1: Define Current State
- Document existing processes, metrics, capabilities
- Identify pain points and bottlenecks
- Gather quantitative data (cycle times, error rates, costs)
- Interview stakeholders to understand challenges

Step 2: Define Future State
- Articulate the desired end state with specific metrics
- Set realistic timelines (6-month, 12-month targets)
- Align with business objectives and strategy
- Get executive buy-in on the vision

Step 3: Identify the Gap
- Compare Current vs Future State across all dimensions
- Quantify the gaps (e.g., "30% longer cycle time than target")
- Prioritize gaps by business impact
- Assess root causes of each gap

Step 4: Build Action Plan
- Create initiatives to close each gap
- Assign owners (using RACI)
- Define milestones and timelines
- Allocate resources and budget
- Establish success metrics

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:

Current State:
- Order processing time: 5 days
- Error rate: 8%
- Customer satisfaction: 72%
- Manual touchpoints: 12

Future State (12 months):
- Order processing time: 2 days
- Error rate: 2%
- Customer satisfaction: 90%
- Manual touchpoints: 3

Gaps Identified:
1. No automated order validation → causing 60% of errors
2. Three disconnected systems → causing delays
3. Unclear ownership → causing rework

Priority Actions:
1. Implement automated validation (Weeks 1-8)
2. Integrate systems via API (Weeks 9-16)
3. Define RACI for order process (Weeks 1-2)

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Making Future State unrealistic or too vague
- Not quantifying the gaps with actual data
- Skipping root cause analysis
- Creating action plans without clear owners
- Ignoring change management needs

SUCCESS METRICS:
- Gap closure rate (% of gaps addressed)
- Time to implement action plan
- ROI of improvements
- Stakeholder satisfaction with process
