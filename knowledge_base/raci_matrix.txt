FRAMEWORK NAME: RACI Matrix

WHAT IT IS:
A responsibility assignment matrix that clarifies roles and decision-making 
authority for projects and processes. RACI stands for Responsible, Accountable, 
Consulted, and Informed - the four types of stakeholder involvement.

WHEN TO USE IT:
- New project kickoffs
- Organizational restructuring
- Process improvement initiatives
- When roles and responsibilities are unclear
- Cross-functional projects with multiple stakeholders
- Post-merger integration
- Resolving bottlenecks caused by unclear ownership

HOW TO APPLY IT:

Step 1: List All Activities/Deliverables
- Break down the project into key tasks or decisions
- Include all major milestones and deliverables
- Be specific (avoid vague tasks like "manage project")
- Typically 10-20 activities for most projects

Step 2: Identify All Stakeholders
- List everyone who touches the work
- Include all levels (executives, managers, individual contributors)
- Don't forget cross-functional partners
- Include external stakeholders if relevant

Step 3: Assign RACI Roles
For each activity, assign one letter per stakeholder:

R = Responsible (does the work)
- The person(s) who actually complete the task
- Can be multiple people
- Should be specific individuals, not roles

A = Accountable (owns the outcome)
- The ONE person who approves the work
- Has final decision-making authority
- Only ONE 'A' per activity (critical rule)
- Usually a manager or executive

C = Consulted (provides input)
- Subject matter experts whose opinions matter
- Two-way communication (they give feedback)
- Involved before decisions are made
- Keep this list small to avoid delays

I = Informed (kept updated)
- People who need to know about progress
- One-way communication (just FYI)
- Notified after decisions are made
- Can be large group

Step 4: Validate and Refine
- Review with all stakeholders
- Check: Does every activity have exactly ONE 'A'?
- Check: Are there too many 'C's? (slows decisions)
- Resolve conflicts or gaps
- Get sign-off from leadership

Step 5: Communicate and Use
- Share matrix with entire team
- Reference during meetings and decisions
- Update as roles evolve
- Use to resolve "who does what" disputes

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:

Project: Customer Onboarding Process Redesign

| Activity | Product Manager | Ops Lead | Tech Lead | CEO | Sales VP |
|----------|----------------|----------|-----------|-----|----------|
| Define requirements | R | C | C | I | C |
| Approve requirements | A | - | - | - | - |
| Design new workflow | C | R/A | R | I | C |
| Build tech solution | I | C | R/A | I | - |
| Test with pilot customers | C | R | C | I | A |
| Train sales team | I | R | I | I | A |
| Launch to all customers | I | R/A | C | A | I |
| Measure success metrics | R/A | R | I | I | C |

Key:
R = Responsible (does the work)
A = Accountable (approves/owns)
C = Consulted (gives input)
I = Informed (kept updated)

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Having multiple 'A's for one activity (creates confusion)
- Having no 'A' for an activity (no clear owner)
- Too many 'C's (slows down decisions - keep to 2-3 max)
- Assigning roles to job titles instead of actual people
- Creating the matrix but not using it
- Making it too detailed (should be high-level activities)
- Not updating it when roles change

SUCCESS METRICS:
- Reduction in "who's responsible for this?" questions
- Faster decision-making time
- Fewer escalations due to unclear ownership
- Stakeholder satisfaction with clarity
- On-time delivery of project milestones
- Reduced duplicate work or dropped tasks
